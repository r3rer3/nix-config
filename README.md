My dotfiles.

Nix functions and structures inspired (or copied) from [https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) and [https://git.zynh.me/Zynh0722/nixos](https://git.zynh.me/Zynh0722/nixos) (and many others).

Overengineered but I want to learn as much Nix as possible.

The fennel compilation for neovim comes from [https://github.com/kotokrad/dotfiles](https://github.com/kotokrad/dotfiles).
